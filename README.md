Founder at Syntegrity.

Syntegrity is the only auditing firm offering both solo and team audits with flexible pricing and niche-specific experts. (If you are a lending platform, only an auditor expert in lending products will audit your product; we don't believe in generalized auditors, especially for larger scopes.)


Our auditors have collectively earned over $1 million across different open-source contest and bounty platforms, thus ensuring the highest possible quality for audits securing hundreds of millions in valuation for projects.

## Benefits:

1. Clients will get niche experts instead of generalized auditors.
2. I lead solo and team audits on demand.
3. Each auditor has a different level of skillset, so we mix and match to give the best possible combination at the best possible price.
