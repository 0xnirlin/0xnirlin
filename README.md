# Syntegrity Lead by Nirlin
Syntegrity is the only auditing firm offering both solo and team audits with flexible pricing and niche-specific experts. (If you are a lending platform, only an auditor expert in lending products will audit your product; we don't believe in generalized auditors, especially for larger scopes.)





# Benefits:
![Group 15](https://i.ibb.co/PmD6Pn7/Group-15.png)





1. Before manual audit each codebase is run through [LightChaser Bot](https://lightchaser.online), cost for this is paid by Syntegrity and nothing is charged to end user. For 1 run light chaser costs $1000.
1. Clients will get niche experts instead of generalized auditors.
2. Founder lead solo and team audits on demand.
3. Each auditor has a different level of skillset, so we mix and match to give the best possible combination at the best possible price.
